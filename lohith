“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.” — Winston Churchill.
This quote captures the essence of perseverance and resilience. It reminds us that both success and failure 
are temporary states; what truly matters is the determination to keep moving forward despite obstacles.
In life, we often focus too much on outcomes, forgetting that growth happens in the journey.
Churchill’s words inspire us to embrace every challenge as a stepping stone and to understand that real
strength lies in enduring through uncertainty with unwavering resolve.
